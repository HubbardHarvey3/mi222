    <h1>April - May 2018</h1>
    <h5>Prayer Letter</h5>

    <p>The past two months have been such a blessing as we continue to watch our son grow and adapt to this new and
        amazing adventure in life. God has truly blessed us in so many ways. We were so blessed to have my mother in law
        with us until May 15th. Her help was greatly appreciated and watching her with Sawyer just melted our hearts. We
        also loved having my father in law and sister in law visit in April. The week they were here went too fast, but
        we cherished our moments and time with them to the fullest. Maurisa was able to sing with her mom and sisters in
        a church service, and it was a blessing to hear my father in law and brother in law both bring updates from
        Mexico and hear them preach! I've also been blessed to preach here at Calvary Baptist Church periodically, and
        preaching a the the jail and local nursing home as well. This church has been a huge blessing to us in so many
        ways from letting us use their mission house, to blessing us with gifts for Sawyer and much more. We were also
        blessed to celebrate our 9 year anniversary together. It's amazing how much the Lord has blessed us with in
        these past nine years. We've experienced times of hardship and gladness, but through it all it's made our
        marriage even stronger.<br>
        <br>
        In May we were able to take a trip to Orlando to get Sawyer's Mexican birth certificate, so he is now officially
        a Mexican citizen and has dual citizenship! I was also blessed to celebrate another year of life, and it was
        even better this year with my little man present to celebrate with us.<br><br>
        We have some things coming up that we'd like you to help us pray about. First, we ask that you help us pray for
        the provision of finances that we still lack toward our paperwork to become Guatemalan residents. We not only
        lack for the paperwork and lawyer fees, but also for our trip back. We look forward to return to Guatemala in
        August and get back to work. The total we lack for all of this is $5,000. Secondly we have lost some of our
        savings toward our vehicle due to medical bills with having the baby. We lack $5,000 to complete what we need
        for another reliable vehicle in Guatemala. Having something reliable and strong is crucial in the area where we
        are. Finally, we ask that you please keep the Guatemala in your prayers as they have gone through such
        devastation with the eruption of Volcano Fuego. Our hearts break, and we cannot wait to get back and help as we
        know the country has a long way to go to fully recover from the eruption. OVer 60 people are confirmed dead with
        hundreds still missing. Plus, the volcano is still producing activity and continues to erupt. Please pray it
        will subside and there won't be anymore people harmed.<br><br>
        We thank each of you for your prayers and support. In addition, to those who have given extra gifts to us and
        for the relief in Guatemala, thank you from the bottom of our hearts! May God continue to bless you in a mighty
        way. <br><br>
        In Christ, <br>
        Adrian and Maurisa Hernandez
