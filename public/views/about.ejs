    <h4>Personal Testimony</h4>
    <p>When I was eight years old, I went to La Fe Baptist Church in Jimenez, Mexico for the first time.  I was living with my Grandmother at the time, due to divorce and the lost condition of my family.  My father was in prison and my mother was in another city working and living.<br>
    I learned one Bible verse the first time I went to Children's Church.  The verse was John 1:4 "In Him was life and life was the light of men."  I didn't understand what that meant, but I fell in love with the church, the preaching, and the love the people had for each other.<br>
    Sadly, the burden of keeping us became too much for my Grandma to bear, and my siblings and I were tossed from relative to relative for the next seven years.  When I was fourteen I was searching for answers and a true love of some kind, but sadness, loneliness, and confusion was all that I found.  I kept turning in my Bible to that same verse in John, but still, I did not understand it.  Finally, at age 16, I returned to my hometown, Jimenez, and found my way back to that little church that gave me my first taste of love.  After one month of going to church, I received Christ as my Savior during an altar call.<br>
    I finally understood what John 1:4 meant, and I wanted that Light in my heart.  It was not long after this that I went to live on the BOys Ranch, run by American missionaries.  I gre in the Lord, and became very attached to the people, the church, and most of all my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

    <h4>Call to Service</h4>
    <p>Always, in my prayers, I would ask the Lord to use me however He wanted to for His service.  I knew that with all the ministries I was working, in I was still not satisfied with my service to the Lord.  I knew that there had to be something more to my walk with the Lord.<br>
    It wasn't until I was twenty years old that the Lord began to burden my soul to "go".  I was earnestly praying, trying to find out where He would have me to "go", when I heard a missionary preaching on what a disciple is.  The missionary said that a disciple is someone who is willing to be "sent".  It was then, that I knew I was willing to go wherever He wanted me to go.  The Lord placed Central America on my heart.  God gave me a strong burden for these people, and in 2007 I went to Guatemala on a mission trip.  I was on this trip that God confirmed that Guatemala was place He wanted me to "go".
